## About This Project

This portfolio is more than just a showcase—it's an interactive, personality-driven experience that represents my skills, humor, and approach to building web applications. The site is fully responsive, performance-optimized, and features custom animations, unique user interactions, and playful elements like **Party Mode** and a **CLI-powered "Get to Know Me" terminal**.

## Key Features

### Get to Know You CLI

A fully interactive command-line interface (CLI) built in React.

- Users can type commands to learn more about me (e.g., `skills`, `projects`, `movies`).
- Includes a hidden **"Party Mode" command** that turns up the energy.
- Built using **React state and event handlers** for command parsing.

### Party Mode – Custom Hook & Context API

A dynamic Party Mode that transforms the entire experience.

- **Built with Context API**, allowing multiple components (CLI, Nav, etc.) to toggle it independently.
- Uses a **custom React Hook** to manage animations and theme changes.
- Integrates **Framer Motion** for smooth transitions.

### Framer Motion Animations

Used throughout the site for bounce effects, hover interactions, and reveal animations.

- **Hover Effects:** Components subtly scale up when hovered.
- **While In View:** Sections animate into place as the user scrolls.
- **Bouncy Elements:** Certain UI elements have a spring effect.

### Custom Theme & UI

A personality-driven UI that leans into visual engagement.

- **Custom animations in Party Mode.**
- CLI responses are crafted with personality for an engaging experience.
